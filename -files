    Fix import paths in game.js and update stylesheet link in index.html … (#76)
    
    …for correct file referencing
    
    ## Summary
    This pull request includes minor improvements to project configuration
    and code import paths. The most significant changes are updates to
    JavaScript import statements for better portability, a fix for the
    stylesheet path in `index.html`, and some project metadata adjustments.
    
    **Import Path Corrections:**
    
    * Updated all import statements in `game.js` to use relative paths
    (e.g., `./enemy.js` instead of `/Code/javaScriptFiles/enemy.js`) for
    improved compatibility across environments.
    
    **Frontend Resource Reference:**
    
    * Fixed the stylesheet link in `index.html` to use a relative path
    (`./Code/cssFiles/style.css`), ensuring the CSS loads correctly
    regardless of the hosting setup.

    61 feat Refactoring aller JS Dateien (#70)
    
    ## Summary
    This pull request primarily introduces updates to project configuration
    files for both JetBrains IDEs and VS Code, along with some minor
    codebase improvements and refactoring for clarity and consistency. The
    most significant changes are several code style and naming corrections.
    
    **Codebase improvements and consistency:**
    
    * Standardized class naming conventions (e.g., `dropSingleUse` →
    `DropSingleUse`, `equipment` → `Equipment`, and `item` → `Item`).
    * Improved import/export structure for JavaScript modules, such as
    making `Enemy` an exported class and importing `Entity` explicitly.
    * Refactored variable naming and initialization in `Entity` class for
    clarity (e.g., `globalEntityX` → `playerGlobalX`).
    * Cleaned up and simplified the `Entity` class by removing unused or
    redundant methods and code.
    
    **Styling updates:**
    
    * Enhanced global styles in `style.css` for better layout, centering,
    and font usage.
    
    **Controls:**
    * Added controls for the Player with Border recognition.
